			<li>Summary. I have some goals. First of all, I'm learning programming because I would like to test myself in completely new field of activity for me. In the very beginning I chose front-end web development. I found it very interesting because of interactive web applications for different platforms, especially for mobile devices. When I have strong skills in front-end, I'll try myself on a server side of development. In general, I enjoy working process as a web developer, expect exciting projects, competitive salary and flexible work schedule. I'm workaholic by my nature.</li>
